# AR-Simtable
AR Sim table for urban flood and traffic simulation based on Kinect


This project was inspired by a Simtable(https://www.simtable.com/) and Augmented Reality Sandbox( http://idav.ucdavis.edu/~okreylos/ResDev/SARndbox/).

Flood simulation is based on the Saint-Venant set of shallow water equations, which are a depth-integrated version of the set of Navier-Stokes equations governing fluid flow, is run in the background using another set of GLSL shaders.
This model is developed based on Augmented Reality Sandbox (Great job!)

Traffic Simulation is based on SUMO. Python TraCI works as a server. The traffic flow is then render on sim-table(using a set of GLSL shaders) and on web(Flask + Socket.IO)
